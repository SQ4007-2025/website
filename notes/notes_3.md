How to download source code into Visual Studio Code

1. Log into [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/).
2. In your terminal window, type

   ```
   wget https://cdn.cs50.net/2024/fall/lectures/2/src2.zip

   ```

   followed by Enter in order to download a Zip file of lecture’s source code into your codespace.
3. In your terminal window, type

   ```
   unzip src2.zip

   ```

   followed by Enter to unzip (i.e., decompress) that Zip file.
4. In your terminal window, type

   ```
   cd src2

   ```

   followed by Enter in order to “change directory” into that `src2` directory (i.e., folder).
5. In your terminal window, type, e.g.,

   ```
   make hello0

   ```

   followed by Enter in order to compile, e.g., `hello0.c` (source code) into `hello0` (machine code).
6. In your terminal window, type, e.g.,

   ```
   ./hello0

   ```

   followed by Enter in order to run, e.g., `hello0`.
